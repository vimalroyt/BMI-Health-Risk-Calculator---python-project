# BMI-Health-Risk-Calculator---python-project
BMI &amp; Health Risk Calculator - python project

This is a simple Python project that calculates **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on user input for height and weight. It then classifies the BMI result into different health risk categories.

## What is BMI?

BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. It helps to assess whether a person is underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese.

## Features

- Interactive user input (no parameters required).
- Height is taken in **centimeters**, weight in **kilograms**.
- Calculates BMI and gives an appropriate **health risk category**.

## BMI Categories

| BMI Range (kg/mÂ²) | Health Category                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| < 18.5            | Possible nutritional deficiency  |
| 18.5 â€“ 24.9       | Low health risk                  |
| 25 â€“ 29.9         | Increased health risk            |
| â‰¥ 30              | Very high health risk (Obese)    |

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

This Jupyter Notebook helps users calculate their **Body Mass Index (BMI)** by entering their height and weight. It then classifies the BMI into one of the standard health risk categories.

## ðŸ’» How to Use

1. Open the `bmi_calculator.ipynb` file.
2. Run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Enter your height (in cm) and weight (in kg) when prompted.

## ðŸ§¾ Sample Output
Enter height_cm here:  155
Enter weight_kg here:  49
result: Your BMI is 20.40 and Low health risk
